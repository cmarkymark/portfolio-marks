<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> So, What’s Different About This Book</h2>
<p>Hello there! My name is Charlie - I am a quantitative researcher with a special focus on substance use. Before becoming a public health researcher, I was a computer programmer. You may be reading this book because you are taking a class with me or you may be reading this book because you are looking for a little boost in your applied statistics education.</p>
<p>In my own PhD training, I was often very frustrated within my statistics courses. Statistical methods were often presented in very abstract terms - we would read about the methods, we would read papers that used the methods, we would go over some examples in class and talk through them, we would discuss the assumptions of the methods, and so on. Too often, the applications of these methods were missing. It sort of felt like learning about a bicycle instead of learning to ride one (as fair warning, I love analogies). At the end of these classes, my peers and I often felt like we still didn’t actually know how to “do statistics” - we could recite assumptions of linear regressions or discuss the steps needed to undertake a mediation study, but we still didn’t feel like we knew what we needed to do to actually conduct a statistical analysis from start to finish.</p>
<p>One huge issue I saw in many courses revolved around programming. In order to “do statistics,” you must become a programmer. Whether you are using R or SAS or Stata, coding is an essential aspect of becoming a confident statistician. However, coding often falls to the wayside as we are taught the foundations of statistics. As a result, when we are actually looking at a dataset for a research project or our dissertation or whatever else, we don’t actually know what to do. It turns out, we never actually learned how to ride the bike!</p>
<p>So, there are two goals in this book:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To teach you about the bike</li>
<li>To teach you how to ride the bike</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first two chapters of this book, we will focus on learning about the R coding language, what it can do and its key features. This is important because coding is complicated! If we know what R is, what it can do, and what it can’t do, it will make learning to apply statistical methods much more straightforward in the long run. It can be pretty painful to be learning brand new statistical methods and a brand new coding language all at once, so these chapters are dedicated to building confidence in navigating and using R.</p>
<p>In the subsequent chapters, we will focus on important statistical methods that we can add to our statistical toolkit. These chapters will focus on what these methods are, how they work, key assumptions in how to use, just like a typical stats class. At the same time, these chapters will focus on displaying steps needed to execute these tests using R. Further, assignments at the end of each chapter can be completed to practice using the method and building confidence in using them!</p>
<p>The assignments are also designed to give you practice with cleaning and manipulating datasets. When we receive data, it often won’t be ready to go - we will need to clean it up and prepare it for analyses. In fact, this activity is the most time consuming part of being a quantitative analyst and I think it should be more present in our applied statistics training.</p>
<p>Finally, the assignments will also focus on how to use R to output results of each of these methods so that we can readily add them to our research reports and manuscripts. There are many tasks that can be automated…I was once talking to a peer who mentioned that they hand-write all of their citations. I was mortified!!! I use citation software and it builds my citations for me (I double check them and modify accordingly of course!). In the same way, we can use R to automate some really time-consuming processes and make our lives a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>Learning statistics and learning is a huge challenge for many of us as we step into our careers as researchers. Too often, it is confusing, complicated, and painful. While I cannot promise it won’t be challenging, I have designed this book to be readily accessible and to help you develop the hard skills to understand and apply statistical methods within your own research.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Is This Book For You?</h2>
<p>Who have I written this book for precisely? My target audience with this book are ascendant social scientists, particularly in public health fields, who have found the quantitative side of research intimidating, confusing, daunting, utterly upsetting, or some combination of these and other negative feelings.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe this book can be useful to anyone seeking to become an applied statistician and who is looking for a friendlier and more accessible introduction. While I am truly grateful for the amazing statistics books available on the market, a 900-page tome is not always the most inviting place to start. I hope that this book may serve individuals for whom traditional statistics curricula and textbooks have not been a good starting place. There are so many ways to learn this trade and we all have different learning styles - I hope this book can serve you in your research journey!</p>
</div>
<div id="the-different-types-of-uncertainty" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> The Different Types of Uncertainty</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the whole “doing statistics” thing – I wanted to have a discussion around uncertainty and confidence. Uncertainty and confidence are going to rear their heads in many, many ways. First, there will be many moments where you will feel uncertain about what you are doing, where you may not feel confident that what you are doing is the right thing. Part of the purpose of this book is to help you navigate through this uncertainty and build confidence in applying different statistical concepts. Second, there will be uncertainty in how to interpret and convey findings from the statistical tests we will execute in this class (and that you will likely continue to use throughout your research career). Especially in the field of human subjects’ research, our research is far from objective in nature. There is uncertainty and, just as important as being able to apply statistical concepts in our research, will be navigating the uncertainty of our findings and determining how confident we are that our findings are meaningful.</p>
<p>Here I wish to focus on three ways that uncertainty will arise in your work as a statistician:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Uncertainty in determining which methods are best to apply for your given research project,</li>
<li>Uncertainty in determining how to execute these methods, once chosen,</li>
<li>Uncertainty in interpreting the results of the tests that you have executed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Becoming a quantitative social scientist is first and foremost about wading through uncertainty – uncertainty about the best way to address a problem, uncertainty about interpreting what you’ve done, uncertainty in determining if what you have done has value. Instead of diving right into learning about and applying statistical techniques, I want to provide some space to really talk about statistics, talk about what the “art” of statistics is about and what it is not.</p>
</div>
<div id="uncertainty-determining-the-best-methods-to-apply" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Uncertainty Determining the Best Methods to Apply</h2>
<div id="your-statistical-toolkit" class="section level3" number="1.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Your Statistical Toolkit</h3>
<p>As applied statisticians, we can understand each statistical technique as a tool that is available to us in our toolkit. Let’s consider somebody building a house – a hammer has long been an important tool for completing many of the tasks necessary to build a house. But a hammer alone does not build a house. The builder requires a blueprint, materials, and the ability to use the hammer and other tools to take the blueprint and materials and turn them into a house! In the end, it takes all of these components to build a structurally sound house. The vision we have is about the house – the tools we choose are in service to this vision.</p>
<p>As statisticians, statistical techniques represent our tools. They are our hammers, nails, saws, and levels. Our research project, in this analogy, is the house. We design the research project (develop our research questions and relevant hypotheses), we gather our materials (collect our data), and then we build our home (test our hypotheses and write a report answering our research questions). The important thing here is that statistical tests must be grounded within our overall study design and must explicitly answer our research questions. The statistical tools are those we choose in service of the vision of our research project. We choose which statistical tools we should employ based on our research question and the data we have available to us.</p>
<p>With a house, it is quite easy to see when the craftsman has made an error of some sort. You know that a roof was built well (enough) if, on a rainy day, water does not drip into the house. It can be a bit more challenging, though, to identify major errors within a quantitative research manuscript because it requires that other people or you identify and point out the error (without even getting into how anxiety inducing fearing you have made a mistake is!). That is why it is important to really understand what the tools we have are and how to use them – otherwise, we risk building a house that leaks when it rains.</p>
<p>On your journey as a statistician, you will frequently be wondering what the best tool to use within each of your research projects is. This is the first source of uncertainty that you will face. Part of this class will be about helping you build the confidence to wade through this uncertainty. Your ability to identify the appropriate statistical tests will grow as you gain more experience and practice at this art! Much like the carpenter who becomes more skilled at their trade with more practice, it will take time to develop your statistical skillset and toolkit – this is natural and you shouldn’t feel like you need to be a master statistician right at the beginning of your research journey.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-to-your-toolkit" class="section level3" number="1.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Adding to Your Toolkit</h3>
<p>Now, one element of your statistical journey will be adding new tools to your toolkit. You could build a house with a hammer – but, a pneumatic nail gun is a far more efficient alternative that will save you time and protect you from accidentally breaking your thumb with your hammer. For the uninitiated craftsman, walking into a hardware store can feel daunting. There are so many tools available, and it is unclear what like 90% of these tools are even for! While there are no statistician stores where you can go to purchase the latest regression technique, the reality is much the same – there are countless tools at your disposal and it isn’t always clear how to use them all or what they are even for. Many of these tools (such as t-tests) are commonplace like the hammer and other tools (such as marginal effects models) may be a bit more daunting to add to your toolkit.</p>
<p>The reason I want to talk about this is to point out that there is never going to a be a “perfect” statistical tool for your given research project. It is quite likely that there will be many statistical tools that are well-suited for your research purposes. Learning about more statistical techniques expands your toolbox and provides you with more options for completing your research project. Each tool comes with its strengths and weaknesses – it is our job as statisticians to wade through uncertainty and choose the tools that are best suited for completing our research project. I even look back at some of my earliest publications and see that I would have done them differently today, now that I have expanded my toolkit. I am still very proud of these papers and think that they are deserving of their place in the academic literature, but I also see that I am on a journey where I am growing and becoming better at my trade. If you are taking this class, you are likely at the beginning of your statistics journey – you are right where you need to be 😊</p>
</div>
<div id="defending-your-choice-in-tools" class="section level3" number="1.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Defending Your Choice in Tools</h3>
<p>A big part of navigating the uncertainty in choosing what methods to use is being able to defend why you chose the tools that you did. A big part of the statistics learning journey is being able to defend your choices. This can help you in two ways: 1) explicitly explaining why you chose a specific tool and defending its appropriateness is a great way to build confidence; and 2) if you cannot defend your choice in tools then it might be a sign that you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new idea.</p>
<p>Every method and every approach has strengths and weaknesses – if you submit your work to an academic journal, there will always be reviewers who ask you questions about these weaknesses. As statisticians, it is important that we do everything we can to maximize the strengths of our methods while minimizing the weaknesses. It is overly ambitious (impossible, I daresay) to think we can run a study free of limitations. There will always be limitations.</p>
<p>One thing I ask that you be cautious of is using a method because it is common to do so. “This is how it is always done” is not a defense of the method itself, but a defense of the field. I simply suggest that you take note of when a method is defended on its merits, or on its acceptance within the research community. I recall certain moments in my own doctoral training where I raised concerns about the inappropriateness of specific statistical tools being employed and the response I received was often “I have used this technique in countless papers, it is fine.” Perhaps more upsetting to me were moments where senior researchers simply shrugged as a way to suggest that the hierarchy of professor versus student meant my critiques were not worthy of response. The reason I raise these points is to let you know that choosing the right methods is also a matter of negotiation with the other researchers that you work with – often times there will be a power dynamic in which you, the student, are required to defend your choices to a much higher standard than your senior peers are. Being able to defend your positions is going to go a long way in helping you navigate these negotiations with co-authors, peers, and mentors.</p>

<div id="uncertainty-in-how-to-implement-the-tools" class="section level2" number="1.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Uncertainty in How to Implement the Tools</h2>
<p>So, you are writing a research paper and you have identified that you need to run a linear regression to test the relationship between two variables. Amazing! You have an excellent justification for using this method and it matches up perfectly with your research question and your study design. Now the question is – how do you do it?</p>
<div id="learning-to-communicate-with-the-computer-in-r" class="section level3" number="1.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Learning to Communicate with the Computer in R</h3>
<p>We will dedicate the first several chapters of this book to learning how to communicate with our computer in R. Doing so is not a trivial task, hence why we are dedicating so much time in this class to practicing coding in R. As you get more experience doing quantitative research, you will start finding that (often) choosing the correct tool is a lot easier than actually implementing the statistical test.</p>
<p>For example, when you have a dichotomous outcome of interest, your brain will get in the habit of suggesting logistic regression as an appropriate tool to consider (we will discuss later in the course!). This is not the only tool available in such circumstances, nor is it always best – but it is often a great starting place. Sometimes, the process of picking the right tool will be instantaneous, much in the same way that a carpenter doesn’t have to think hard to know that a hammer is the right tool for driving nails into wood.</p>
<p>Now, just because the carpenter knows the hammer is the right tool to use does not mean that driving one hundred nails is trivial or easy work. This work is also much easier for the trained hand who has done it before. It is painstaking and takes time, but with practice becomes much easier (though not necessarily easy). Much in the same way, executing our statistical methods is often more work than actually picking out the appropriate methods.</p>
<p>That is why we will spend so much time in this class implementing our statistical tools in R. Especially the first time you implement a tool in R, you will be uncertain if you are doing things correctly. Through repetition and practice you will gain more confidence in applying these techniques. Even better is that when you learn how to implement a tool in R, you can actually save the code you used so you can use it again later. That is why this book is full of copy-pasta files – while memorizing code can help you move faster, it is far from necessary to be an effective statistician. But, you do need to be able to know how to implement these tools, be confident that you have done it correctly, and be able to do so in new circumstances.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="uncertainty-in-interpreting-our-results" class="section level2" number="1.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Uncertainty in Interpreting Our Results</h2>
<p>One of the greatest challenges in quantitative research is interpreting your findings. Many of us are accustomed to reading sentences such as “Men are significantly more likely to start smoking cigarettes than women” or “patients who received the treatment had significant reductions in the disease than those who received the placebo.” This word, significant, appears a lot. It is sort of this magic holy grail that we often are hoping to see. Some of you might know to look and see if p is less than 0.05 – that’s when we know we have that significant finding!</p>
<p>While the concept of significance holds valuable information (which we will continue to discuss), as we progress through this class, I want to challenge you to think critically about your results and critically about this buzzword. Personally, I refrain from ever using the word “significance” in my quantitative papers. I have a paper dedicated to this you can find <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00815/full">here</a>, but, in short, the word “significant” isn’t very descriptive. It doesn’t actually provide much information when it comes to answering your research question. When we focus on finding significance instead of answering our research questions, the quality of our research suffers as a result.</p>
<p>There are two things I want you to consider whenever you are reading a paper. The first is that non-significant findings are still meaningful and worthy of reflection. The second is that significant findings are not inherently meaningful in relation to our research question. For example, we could have a significant finding that men are 1% more likely than women to smoke cigarettes – while this is significant, one could argue that men having a 1% greater likelihood of smoking than women is a bit meaningless from a practical standpoint. Now, if you feel you can argue that a 1% increase in risk is meaningful, then I encourage you to make that argument! Often, the “culture” of significance is that we do not need to argue that a significant finding is meaningful – I encourage you to always reflect on the meaning of your findings in relation to your research question.</p>
<p>Similarly, we could imagine another study where we find that men are 3-times more likely (300% greater likelihood) to smoke cigarettes than women but that the p-value is greater than 0.05. We just didn’t have a whole lot of power, the sample size was small, but the signal within the sample indicates that men were much more likely to report smoking. While this doesn’t meet the bar of significance like the other study, a 300% increased risk of smoking has much clearer intervention and policy implications.</p>
<div id="what-can-a-statistical-test-tell-us" class="section level3" number="1.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> What Can a Statistical Test Tell Us?</h3>
<p>One of the big things in this class will not only be learning how to select a statistical tool and how to apply it, but to also know how to interpret what it is telling us. “Significance” is one thing that a statistical tool can reflect upon, but it is always important to learn how to read all the information that a statistical tool returns to us. A logistic regression doesn’t just return a bunch of p-values – it returns point estimates and standard errors that we can then translate into odds ratios and confidence intervals. It also provides us information on how well our model fits to the data, which can be important diagnostic information. Each statistical tool available to us returns its own kind of information. Ideally, we will select statistical tools that provide us information that can help us answer our research questions! Part of learning to apply statistical tools will be learning how to navigate all of the information that they return to us.</p>

<div id="in-conclusion" class="section level2" number="1.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> In Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this Introduction, I wanted to introduce myself and explain the reasons I put this book together! As well, I wanted to reflect on the complex ways that uncertainty can raise its head when applying statistics. We have to wade uthrough ncertainty in knowing what statistical tools can help us answer our research questions, in knowing how to actually execute the tools we have identified as appropriate, and in knowing how to interpret the results of using these tools so we can answer our research question. As we move through this book, we will focus on each of these pieces. As we learn a new technique we will learn how it works, when to use it, how to use it, and how to interpret the results.</p>
<p>By the end of this class you will have expanded your toolkit with tools and you will develop the skills to know when to use these tools, how to use them, how to interpret their results, and to defend their use in your own research!</p>
