    Hello! I am Charles Marks (they/them), MPH, PhD. I am a subtance use researcher at the University of California San Diego and the University of Nevada, Reno. 
  My research has focused on a wide range of topics including: cigarette use, injection drug use, opioid overdose. I apply a wide range of statistical and mathematical modeling
  strategies within my research, but I am also quite critical of the application of quantitative methods within substance use epidemiology. I led the development of the Trauma-Informed
  Theory of Individual Health Behavior -- the theory posits that people make their best effort to address the most immeidate harms they face and, thus, that providing individuals
  and communities the resources and autonomy to address such harms is the best way to empower folx to live healthful lives.
