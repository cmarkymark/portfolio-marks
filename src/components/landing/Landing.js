      Hello!  I (they/them) am a current doctoral student at SDSU and UCSD.  This site is largely under construction at the moment, but
  I am hosting it as a space to share, and reflect on my research and teaching work, as well as to share extracurriculars that have been 
  a requisite component of my academia self-care routine.  I will make this more formal in the coming months. -CM (1/16/20)
