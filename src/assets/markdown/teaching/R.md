## Applied R Tutorials for Social Scientists

(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

So, one of the things that really bothered me while I was going through my statistics training is that I felt like I didn't get the hands 
experience running code in R. It is very important to have the theoretical principles underlying applied stats, but implementing things 
in R shouldn't be a huge barrier. On this page, I am providing tutorials for running R code to execute different statistical techniques 
that are important to be able to run -- as social scientists. I hope that this may be a resource for anyone who is looking 
for very straightforward implementations -- often the tutorials I find online have a lot of stuff to wade through. Please reach out to me
if you find any errors or issues or if there are topics you would like to see covered:

Here are some tutorials:
