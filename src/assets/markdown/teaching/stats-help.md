## Stats Made Simple

### I hope

So, as I have been teaching statistics and working on research teams, I have found that many "simple" statistics are rather difficult to explain.
I figured I would use this page to share some slides for when I figure out a good way to explain a concept. 
I will up date as I go, but if you find anything helpful feel free to use in your own teaching, work, or whatever, just include a link back to here
so other folks can access if they wish to!
