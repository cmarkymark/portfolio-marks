## Using Amazon AWS for Teaching: A Tutorial for Educators

Hey everyone, I have wanted to create this for a long time but coronavirus has pushed me to a place where I have had 
to implement this at scale. Essentially, for my stats lab (which requires SPSS), several of my students are unable to run SPSS
on their personal computers at home, so I created virtual machines (Amazon AWS EC2) for each student with SPSS pre-downloaded. I set
it up so all they have to do is enter their personal license and they are off to the races. This can be done for students who
don't have a computer that runs the software needed for class, whether because their computers are old or because they have chosen
a financially responsible option (such as a chromebook). As educators, this is a tool we can use, especially in a time of crisis, like 
right now to help our students learn without burdening them.

### What is in this tutorial?

I will explain how to: 1) apply for an Amazon AWS Educator credit; 2) create a virtual machine and put the necessary software on it; 
and 3) create a copy of this virtual machine for every student that needs it. While this is straightforward, it can be really complicated
to figure out if you have never done it before. I will walk you through these steps with a series of videos that I hope can help you
provide your students the virtual classroom that they need.
