<!--- Music -->

Parallel to my academic journey has been my musical one. While the intention of this website isn't to share about my music, I did want to include as I don't think I can accurately reflect on my academic life without at least sharing a little of my music life. 

I am a folk musician, playing clawhammer banjo, finger style guitar, and singing. As of writing this I have a banjo album of traditionals out on Spotify, BandCamp, and on CD. I have another album of original music coming out in July of 2021. You can check out my music by heading to charliemarksmusic.com/links .

As well, I am active on YouTube and Patreon and post banjo lessons. Below I have included a YouTube imbed where you can check out some of my playing -- feel free to head that way and subscribe if interested :) You can also follow along on Instagram: @charlie_marks_music
