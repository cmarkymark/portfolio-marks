<!--- Banjo -->

Something about playing the banjo in the clawhammer (overhand/frailing) style that just really clicked with whatever goes on inside my head and hands.  Living in San Diego, it has been hard to find an old time presence, and I am really grateful for the online old time banjo community for sharing their music and resources.  I've wanted a space and way to share music and to push myself to dive deeper into it, so I've been posting songs on the YouTube.  Enjoy!
