# Charlie's Sourdough (for) Starters Recipe



So, I was motivated to make this tutorial as the coronavirus has left many of us isolated at home -- giving us all time to spend in the kitchen. I feel like a situation like this has made it pretty clear how dependent we all are on society to have access to all of our basic needs. Making sourdough bread feels like one way to kind of have some control over food production and there are a bunch of health benefits compared to using an instant rise yeast -- all you need is flour, water, and salt (and your sourdough starter) and you can make some amazing ass bread.

## You Need A Sourdough Starter

So, before you make sourdough you do need a sourdough starter. There are many tutorials of how you can make them at home, such as [here](https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2019/03/beginner-sourdough-starter-recipe/). This process takes around a week. If you do not want to wait out this process, look up a local bakery, go (or find someone who is able to go) to the bakery, purchase a sourdough starter (often they will just give it to you for free). Sourdough starter is a fermented mix of flour and water. It is constantly multiplying, so it is no sweat for a bakery to give you some -- they likely have a tub in the back with an every-expanding starter in it. While you are there, support and tip the local business, especially if this coronavirus business is going on. Food service workers are basically frontlines with this shit. I have often found that bakers are stoked you want a starter and even had one place request I bring them a loaf to share together!

## What You Need

This recipe will make two small loaves of bread or one big loaf of bread.  The ingredients you will need are:


<div class = "left">
  
- 900 g of flour (approximately 6 cups)
  - At least 600 g of unbleached white flour
  - The other 300 g can be whole wheat if you want, or white. 
- 675 g of water (675 mL)
- 20 g of salt (~1 Tsp)
- A Sourdough Starter


</div>


The tools you will need:

<div class="left">

- One big bowl to mix everything in and store your dough
- A dough scraper (can be replaced with a bread knife or other rigid flat thing)
- Either a scale or measuring cups and tablespoon
- A fork for mixing
- Parchment Paper or Tin Foil for baking on
- An oven
- 2 Trays/Pans/Tins/etc for baking on
  - The perfect tin is like a banana bread loaf tin!
  - Can also be free-form (ie just placed a flat surface)
  - If you have a dutch oven that is also great!

</div>


This process is intended to take ~24 hours. If you skip step 1, your bread won't be as sour but you can complete this process in 12 hours. Step 1 occurs the evening before and the remaining steps occur the next day. Overall, this recipe is generally pretty forgiving, so if you don't do the times exactly, eh, life happens.

## Step 1: Getting Everything Started (Optional for Making Sour Bread)

So the night before, you are going to start your dough.  You will need:

<div class="left">

- 300 g of flour (~2 cups)
  - If you are using any whole wheat, this is when you will use it
- 300 g of luke-warm water (300 mL)
- About 100 g of sourdough starter
  - If you don't have a scale, a glob that covers the bottom of your bowl should do

</div>

So, all we are going to do is mix these ingredients together in a bowl. You will cover the bowl, and leave it for over night! Below is a video showing these steps and explaining some additional information:

## Step 2: Making Your Dough

In the morning, grab your bowl and you should find your creation from the night before is a bit bubbly and maybe a little stinky -- depending on where you are, what kind of flour you used, etc, it's going to look different!

Now we are going to make our dough.  You are going to add the following to your fermented dough:


- 600 g of white flour (~4 cups)
- 375 g of water (375 mL)
- 20 g of salt (~1 tbsp)


**If you skipped step one**, you are going to mix all the ingredients from both step one and two:



- 900 g of flour (~6 cups)
- 675 g of luke-warm water (675 mL)
- 20 g of salt (~1 tbsp)
- About 100 g of sourdough starter


Once you have mixed everything and have your dough, you are going to let it sit for 1 - 4 hours. If you are in a super time crunch, you can wait ~20 minutes before continuing to step 3. This allows for the dough to autolyze, which is important for gluten formation.

Below is a video showing these steps and explaining some additional information:

## Step 3: Stretch and Fold

Next we are going to stretch and fold our bread. This is a **no knead** reciple, so at no point will we knead the dough. This is perhaps the trickiest part of the whole process and I think a video is most helpful (see below). You will need a flat surface (such as a counter or table) and your dough scraper (or bread knife or other flat tool). You will plop your dough onto the surface (**do not flour the surface**).  You will (rather aggressively) slide the scraper under one side of the dough, stretch it, and then fold it over itself. You will rotate the dough 90 degrees using the bread scraper and repeat -- repeating this process until the dough doesn't really want to be folded, though 4 times is a safe number if you are unsure. After the last stretch and fold you will return it to the bowl. You will stretch and fold every 30 minutes for 2 hours (this is a total of 5 times). If you are in a time crunch you can do it every 15 minutes for an hour.

Below is a video showing how to stretch and fold:

## Step 4: Let it Rise

After you complete your stretch and folds, let it rise! This can be anywhere from 2 - 8 hours (depending on what time it is and what time you want to bake at). I often try to time this process up so that I let it rise until 5 or 6 PM so I can be baking around 8.

Here is a before photo of my bread at the end of step 3 (left) and after letting rise for about 4 hours (right):

<div class="row" style="display: flex">
  <div class="column" style="width:50%; padding: 5px">
    <img src="Pics/Dough_Before.jpg" alt="Before" style="width:100%" >
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="width:50%; padding: 5px">
   <img src="Pics/Dough_Before.jpg" alt="After" style="width:100%">
  </div>
</div>


Again, the amount of rise is dependent on a ton of factors, so don't worry if you didn't get the same amount of rise as me.

## Step 5: Splitting Our Dough For Two Loaves and One Last Stretch and Fold

At this point, your dough should be nice and airy. Take care not to squish your dough too much. We were really patient to get this air so we don't want to totally deflate it (but we are totally about to deflate a good amount and that is totally okay!).

We are going to make two small loaves of bread (in case you want to share with friends or want nice sized pieces of toast!). I would get the pans you are going to cook on and some parchment paper to place the dough on (or if you don't have it, tin foil can work).

I usually do not pre-flour my surface for this step, but you can if you want. You will need a bag of flour handy though to complete this step.

First, you will dump your dough onto surface. Try tour best not to squish it! You will use your scraper or knife to split the dough in half. What I do is I start the cut and then use my hand to start pulling away one of the halves as I continue the cut (see the video below). The scraper or knife is a good tool for moving your dough across your surface.

You will repeat the following steps for each of your two halves. First, you are going to do one set of stretch and folds just like in Step 3 (ie four stretch and folds total). This is going to be our final dough ball, so we are going to flour it up. Start by sprinkling flour over the top of it. Spread that flour around so that it is not sticky to the touch. Next, to get the underside, sprinkle flour around the base of your dough ball and use your spreader or knife to push the flour under the dough ball (see video). Do this until the dough ball is not sticky. I don't recommend trying to pick the dough ball up with your hands. I would place the parchment paper down next to the dough ball and use your scraper to lift or skooch (sp?) your dough ball onto the middle of your parchment paper. Pick the dough up using the parchment paper and play it in/on the tray/tin you are using to bake. 

We are now going to let it sit for 1 hour or so for its final rise!

## Step 6: Baking!

Start by preheating your oven to 500 degrees (we are going to eventually bake at 450). The total baking time is going to be 40 minutes. We want to steam the bread for the first 20 minutes and then remove the steam for the last 20 minutes. To do this, boil some water. Pour the boiling water into something oven safe and place the boiling water into the oven. Voila. You have created a steam oven! If your baking tin has a lid, you can just put a lid over the dough and then you won't need to create a steam oven.

Once your oven is hot turn it down to 450 degrees. Get ready to put your two loaves in the oven. Grab your loaves. Sprinkle some more flour over the top of your loaves.  Grab the sharpest knife you have and make some slits in the top of the bread (these slits give the bread room to expand). You can make your bread pretty by drawing various patterns with your splits. A nice X through the middle of a round loaf is a classic pattern or some diagonal hatches across a rectangular loaf can also be nice. Immediately after making the slits place the loaves into the oven! (If you are using lids instead of the steam oven, put the lids on before placing in the oven). 

The video below documents this set of steps:

Set a timer for 20 minutes. Once the timer goes off, remove the water from the oven and let the oven sit slightly ajar for like 15 seconds to let the steam out. Be careful, if your water has not fully evaporated it is boiling water. If you get it on your oven mitt, this will scald you. Dump the water so no one accidentally gets burned -- metal cools a lot faster than water does (I think). If you used lids, then remove the lids at this point. At this point, your bread should have risen but will likely be light pasty color still. Here is what mine looked like:

Set a timer for another 20 minutes. After 20 minutes you should be all done! Take a look. If the outside is still a light color (ie there is no dark brown), you can leave it in another 5 minutes or so. Take the bread out of the oven. Here is what mine looked like:

## Step 7: LET IT COOL OFF!!!!

The bread is not done cooking! The residual heat is cooking the inside of the bread. Do not cut into it. If you were to poke a hole in your loaf at this point, a steam jet would start spraying out. That steam is cooking the inside of the bread! You need to wait at least 1 hour.

## Step 8: Dig in

You did it!

Here is what the inside of my bread looks like, for reference:

If this is your first time making sourdough, it might not turn out just right, that's okay!! Just keep at it, read up on different methods. I hope this has helped you give it a shot!!
