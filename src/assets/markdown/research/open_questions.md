<!--- Open Questions --->

On this page, I wanted to document some broader research questions that I don't think the research community has effectively addressed or that I think aren't always adequately accounted for in research. Further, I would be grateful if anybody would research these, so please, if you have done research on this topic I would to read it :)

**It is estimated that cigarettes kill 500,000 people every year (attributable deaths) and that overdoses result in around 50,000 - 75,000 deaths annually. How do we think through these values? How do we compare them? More broadly, how do we compare acute deaths (such as overdose) versus deaths as a result of long-term exposures (such as smoking attributable deaths)?**

One of the realities of being a human is that something is going to kill us...ideally that something is time and old age. 

**Does prescribing Adderall (amphetamine) to youth potentiate methamphetamine/stimulant use as an adult? More broadly, does prescribing youth pharmaceutical drugs potentiate adult drug use?**

**How do we appropriately contextualize the neurodevelopmental impacts of youth drug use compared to competing exposures? Story Problem Version: A teenager likes to smoke cannabis because it reduces anxiety. Their doctor mentioned to them that smoking cannabis can negatively impact their neurodevelopment...however, when they went home, they were on Google and found a meta-analysis which showed that anxiety during youth negatively impacts neurodevelopment as well. How do we as drug use researchers think through this?**

**Traditional Cultural Knowledge of drug use is generally not elevated in the ways academic research is (hence terms like 'Complimentary and Alternative Medicine'). However, cultural knowledge rooted in generations (often over centuries or even millienia) is developed similar to academic knowledge and with one additional benefit: time. One of the biggest challenges in undertaking causal research is time. That is why multi-decade studies are so important and so challenging to put together. Causation is temporal. Traditional knowledge, while generally specific to the context (such as the physical geography) of a given community, has developed over decades, centuries, and/or millenia. The purpose of traditional forms of knowledge, unlike most academic research is devoted to praxis: it is the application of knowledge for specific purposes in a persons life. Academic research is frequently dedicated to explanation and is almost always removed from the context in which such knowledge can be applied -- when it is applied it is generally the unaffected (say people who do not smoke cigarettes) applying this knowledge upon people who are affected (say people who do smoke cigarettes). Let us consider psychodelic drugs: many traditional practices around such substances are focused on how to use said substance for specific purposes...however, scientific research often focuses on the mechanisms by which the drugs act, measurable impacts of such drugs, neurodevelopmental harms, and so on. Traditional knowledge frequently situates drug use as a part of life whereas scientific pursuits generally situate drug use within the laboratory (or, will try to control extenauting factors to simulate an experimental design).**

**How do we categorize drug use at a social level? Currently, as a society, we focus on distinctions made by legal status and by social desriability. Scientifically, we generally approach drug classes by their mechanism of action -- opioids act on opioid receptors, etc. Further, we often fail to make distinctions between organic and synthetic products. Below are a series of questions building off this:**

- The gateway theory of drug use was based in demonizing drug use and placing moral blame for escalating drug use on the person. However, there appears to be a lack of acknowledgement that use of a given drug class will potentiate drug use of that same class. For example, we understand that prescription opioid use potentiates heroin use. However, it isn't widely accepted that e-cigarette use may potentiate cigarette use via nicotine depedence. Further, there is basically no research about the association between prescription stimulants (Adderall) and methamphetamine/cocaine use.

**As drug use researchers, what is our responsibility to discuss our personal drug use? Frequently, we only hear about a person's drug use when shit hits the fan. Narratives of individuals finding a balance of drug use with other aspects of their life are rendered largely invisible, especially as we work our way up the career ladder and their is heightened undesirability/fear in revealing one's drug use. As such, what responsibility do we hold as drug use researchers in being open about our own drug use and how does our status as people who use (or don't use) drugs impact the validity of our work**
