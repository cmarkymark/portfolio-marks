<!--- Open Questions --->

On this page, I wanted to document some broader research questions that I don't think the research community has effectively addressed.

**It is estimated that cigarettes kill 500,000 people every year (attributable deaths) and that overdoses result in around 50,000 - 75,000 deaths annually. How do we think through these values? How do we compare them? More broadly, how do we compare acute deaths (such as overdose) versus deaths as a result of long-term exposures (such as smoking attributable deaths)?**

One of the realities of being a human is that something is going to kill us...ideally that something is time and old age. 

**Does prescribing Adderall (amphetamine) to youth potentiate methamphetamine/stimulant use as an adult? More broadly, does prescribing youth pharmaceutical drugs potentiate adult drug use?**

**How do we appropriately contextualize the neurodevelopmental impacts of youth drug use compared to competing exposures? Story Problem Version: A teenager likes to smoke cannabis because it reduces anxiety. Their doctor mentioned to them that smoking cannabis can negatively impact their neurodevelopment...however, when they went home, they were on Google and found a meta-analysis which showed that anxiety during youth negatively impacts neurodevelopment as well. How do we as drug use researchers think through this?**
