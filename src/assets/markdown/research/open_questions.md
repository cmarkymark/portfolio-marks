<!--- Open Questions --->

On this page, I wanted to document some broader research questions that I don't think the research community has effectively addressed.

**It is estimated that cigarettes kill 500,000 people every year (attributable deaths) and that overdoses result in around 50,000 - 75,000 deaths annually. How do we think through these values? How do we compare them? More broadly, how do we compare acute deaths (such as overdose) versus deaths as a result of long-term exposures (such as smoking attributable deaths)?**

**Does prescribing Adderall (amphetamine) to youth potentiate methamphetamine/stimulant use as an adult?**
