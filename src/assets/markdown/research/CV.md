## Teaching

#### Spring 2020: Lecturer for SW-610 Computer Applications in Social Work Practice @ SDSU

SW-610 is a Master's level statsitics course for MSW students in the SDSU School of Social Work. 
This course is an introduction to applying statistical methods in social work research.
The course introduces SPSS and the students work in groups to produce a quantitative research project from a publiclly available data set.
Teaching evaluations from this course are available [here](Teaching_Evaluations/SW610_Evaluation.pdf)

#### Fall 2019: TA for SW-610 Computer Applications in Social Work Practice @ SDSU

#### 2012 - 2014: Teaching Assistant in the Oberlin College Computer Science Department
